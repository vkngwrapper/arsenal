// BlockList is an interface that is used to indicate a single block-bearing memory pool from a consuming application.
// The defragmentation code uses this to communicate back to a memory pool that holds the allocations being
// relocated in the code calling into the defragmentation process.
//
// Semantically, it is expected that a BlockList represent several pages of memory, identified by index, and
// each page has several allocations of type T that point into various offsets in the memory page.
//
// The memory page is represented within memutils by metadata.BlockMetadata, which tracks where the offsets
// of free and allocated memory are.
//
// If you are attempting to use memutils to implement a new type of memory manager with defragmentation, you
// will need a memory pool object to implement this interface.

	// MetadataForBlock retrieves the metadata.BlockMetadata corresponding to the memory page identified by
	// the provided index
