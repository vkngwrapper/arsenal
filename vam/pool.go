// Pool is a structure that can be created to allow allocations that have unusual properties compared to the
// default behavior of allocations made via the Allocator. There are many features that can be unliked
// using Pool objects, but it is almost always better, more performant, and more straightforward to use
// the Allocator instead. Only use a Pool if there is no way you can do without them.
//
// Some possibilities:
//
// * Perform some allocations with the PoolCreateLinearAlgorithm in order to create an arena, stack, or
// queue of quickly allocated-and-deallocated tiny allocations without having to worry about defragmentation.
// * Have a managed pool of memory that is allocated differently from ordinary memory using PoolCreateInfo.MemoryAllocateNext
// * Have a pool of memory that is allocated to blocks but has a different ext_memory_priority priority than Allocator
// memory.
